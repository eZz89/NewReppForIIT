<div class="selectionContent">
<article>

<p>My interest in I.T. probably started over 10 years ago when I worked for a
not-for-profit organisation that modified and maintained elderly and disabled
peoples homes.</p>

<p>The organisation had recieved government funding to develop a database that
could be utilised by other organisations operating government funded home
modification and maintenance services across NSW and Australia.</p>

<p>I was apart of the team invloved in developing this intranet client
database.</p>

<p>I played around with the backend after our hotsing company showed us a
quick, "if we really get keen", rundown of htmls and how to upload files and
modify data fields on our intranet.</p>

<p>By the end of the database development I had saved our organised thousands
of dollars in I.T. database modification and maintenance hours which would have
been billed at a much higher rate than my 18 year old accounts officer rate of
pay.</p>

<p>The hosting company also offered me a job, however I was entering the
accounting industy and didnt know I.T. was the path I wanted to go down.</p>

<p>Since then, I.T. has regularly been of interest to me, from rooting phones
to jailbreak them, to formattiing usb and external hard drives via command
prompt. I've always just had an interest in what else I.T. can do.</p>

<p>Elon Musk is also my biggest hero. Neuralink and spaceX are my favourite
companies. I would love to somehow get involved in anything he is doing. I
believe he has the good of humity at heart and believe in his direction. Im
also big on free speech. :) </p>

  <h1>The Gift of Empathy</h1>
  <p>Mediators share a sincere curiosity about the depths of human nature.
    Introspective to the core, they’re exquisitely attuned to their own
    thoughts and feelings, but they yearn to understand the people around
    them as well. Mediators are compassionate and nonjudgmental, always
    willing to hear another person’s story. When someone opens up to them
    or turns to them for comfort, they feel honored to listen and be of help.
    For Mediators, an ideal relationship of any kind is one in which both
    people feel comfortable sharing not just their wildest hopes and
    dreams but also their secret fears and vulnerabilities.
    Empathy is among this personality type’s greatest gifts, but at times it can
    be a liability. The troubles of the world weigh heavily on Mediators’
    shoulders, and these personalities can be vulnerable to internalizing
    other people’s negative moods or mindsets. Unless they learn to set
    boundaries, Mediators may feel overwhelmed by just how many wrongs
    there are that need to be set right.</p>

    <h1>Speaking Their Truth</h1>
    <p>Few things make Mediators more uneasy than pretending to be someone
      they aren’t. With their sensitivity and their commitment to authenticity,
      people with this personality type tend to crave opportunities for creative
      self-expression. It comes as no surprise, then, that many famous
      Mediators are poets, writers, actors, and artists. They can’t help but muse
      about the meaning and purpose of life, dreaming up all sorts of stories,
      ideas, and possibilities along the way.
      Mediators have a talent for self-expression. They may reveal their
      innermost thoughts and secrets through metaphors and fictional
      Through these imaginative landscapes, Mediators can explore their own
      inner nature as well as their place in the world. While this is a beautiful
      trait, these personalities sometimes show a tendency to daydream and
      fantasize rather than take action. To avoid feeling frustrated, unfulfilled,
      or inc  apable, Mediators need to make sure that they take steps to turn
      their dreams and ideas into reality.</p>

      <h1>In Search of a Calling</h1>
      <p>People with this personality type tend to feel directionless or stuck until
      they connect with a sense of purpose for their lives. For many Mediators,
      this purpose has something to do with uplifting others and their ability to
      feel other people’s suffering as if it were their own. While Mediators want
          to help everyone, they need to focus their energy and efforts – otherwise,
      they can end up exhausted.
      Fortunately, like flowers in the spring, Mediators’ creativity and idealism
      can bloom even after the darkest of seasons. Although they know the
      world will never be perfect, Mediators still care about making it better
      however they can. This quiet belief in doing the right thing may explain
      why these personalities so often inspire compassion, kindness, and
      beauty wherever they go.</p>
